# jQuery UI Contenteditable

Lightweight jQuery UI plugin providing more convinient API to use "contenteditable" feature.

It allows you to make contents of HTML element easily editable using a single click.

## Features

- Extremely lightweight!
- Using native HTML "contenteditable" attribute, in opposite to other similar plugins using inputs and textareas.
It has its own pros and cons, however:
  - :+1: Automatically supports original styling of editable element (as there's no need to replace it with masked input field)
  - :+1: Automatic HTML escaping which "contenteditable" provides out of box (which might be browser-specific, though)
  - :-1: Lower browsers compatibility (read [more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable))
- Customizable input validation via callbacks
- Source code in 3 samples: *ES 2015*, *ES 5.1* and *ES 5.1 minified*
- jQuery UI widget-styled. It means **dependency on jQuery UI** widget factory, which is most likely a negative point.

## Disclaimer

The plugin was written as a part of a bigger private project and so was first of all intended to fit its needs.
I admit it might be not highly flexible, but still don't have enough time to improve it and reply to all the found issues.

In the same time I am encouraging any contribution and ready to help with any questions.

It's my first public repo, don't blame me much ;)
